# Neighborhood Map Project
Neighborhood is the Final project in Udacity's Nanodegree course.<br>
I've used React framework and Javascript API to complete this project.

## APIs
Google Maps API is used here to show the map and generate the markers etc. Foursquare API is used to pull more information on my favorite locations and provide a more complete listing when you click on the marker and the infoWindow shows up.

## How To use neighborhood app 
1) Clone or download repo
2) run npm install in the project directory
3) run npm start that will let the app to run in localhost:3000
